ChessRutgers

Java Program written for CS213: Software Methodology during my fourth semester at Rutgers University. Our
task was to write a working Chess game utilizing Java's Object Oriented Programming. The game had to initiate
a Chess Board created using only ASCII characters. Each move would be entered using the location of the piece
to be moved and then the location the piece is to move to. Each move had to be checked for legality and then 
executed. Between each move, checks for Check, Checkmate, and Stalemate had to happen to know when the game 
would end.
